Problem: 
the value of TT_F1 is designed to be less important than that of TT_M0, but from the distribution, it's not the case. And our PSO is not either such an intelligent one. 

Solution: 
my solution is simply to control their relation by limiting the range of searching space. It means that the upper bound of TT_F1 and the lower bound of TT_M0 are set to be 795.5

20160127£º
Problem: 
the distribution of TT_F1 is not so beautiful because some of them centralized at the upper bound. 

Solution:
the upper bound of TT_F1 is set to be smaller like 750

20160129:
Problem:
some of the TT_M0 estimation are centralized at the upper bound [950,1000].

Solution:
the upper bound of TT_M0 is changed to be 950.

20160130:
Problem: Still, the TT_M0 distribution is not so beautiful, still some estimation at bound.

Solution:TT_M0:[800,900]


20160131:
Problem: Still, there are some estimated values (about 10%) centralized at the upper bound. But comparing the results of 0130 and those of 0131, there is no great differences between them.

Solution: the parameters TT_F1 and RUE both have good distributions. so firstly their values are considered to be obtained. 
we take the mean: RUE_pot=3.3269;TT_F1=708.7778
and we try to estimate TT_M0,TT_M3 and A2.

A2:10-19    14.5
TTM0:800-900    850    
TTM3:1300-1650  1475

20160203:
Problem: It is not a good idea to bring TT_M0 in the estimation. Because it changes a lot compared with the last one. So, the next step will not have TT_M0 with TT_M3.

Solution:
we take the mean: RUE_pot=3.3269;TT_F1=708.7778,TT_M0=867.6284
and the parameters to be estimated will be TT_M3 and A2.

20160205:
so these two parameters TT_M3 and A2 have good distributions.
and there is no big difference between 0203 and 0205. the only parameter that is not so stable is TT_M0, in my opinion, it is because the sensibility index for TT_M0 is so insignificant that it changes a lot.

20160208:
so I just wander if I could estimate these four parameters: A2, RUE, TT_M3 and TT_F1 together.
but according to the results, it's not so easy as I supposed.
I gave up the estimation with so many parameters.

20160219:
I just repeat the experiment of 20160129 but with nbr_senarios=400

I got 	RUE_pot=3.3242;	TT_M0=868.7222; TT_F1=707.9132


20160221:
I just repeat the experiment of 20160129 but with nbr_senarios=500

I got 	RUE_pot=3.3253;	TT_M0=869.346; TT_F1=707.359


20160303:
I just repeat the experiment of 20160205 but with nbr_senarios=400

I got 	RUE_pot=3.3242;	TT_M0=868.7222; TT_F1=707.9132

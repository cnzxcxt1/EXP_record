Problem: 
the value of TT_F1 is designed to be less important than that of TT_M0, but from the distribution, it's not the case. And our PSO is not either such an intelligent one. 

Solution: 
my solution is simply to control their relation by limiting the range of searching space. It means that the upper bound of TT_F1 and the lower bound of TT_M0 are set to be 795.5

Problem: 
the distribution of TT_F1 is not so beautiful because some of them centralized at the upper bound. 

Solution:
the upper bound of TT_F1 is set to be smaller like 750

20160129:
Problem:
some of the TT_M0 estimation are centralized at the upper bound [950,1000].

Solution:
the upper bound of TT_M0 is changed to be 950.

20160130:
Problem: Still, the TT_M0 distribution is not so beautiful, still some estimation at bound.

Solution:TT_M0:[800,900]


20160131:
Problem: Still, there are some estimated values (about 10%) centralized at the upper bound. But comparing the results of 0130 and those of 0131, there is no great differences between them.

Solution: the parameters TT_F1 and RUE both have good distributions. so firstly their values are considered to be obtained. 
we take the mean: RUE_pot=3.3269;TT_F1=708.7778
and we try to estimate TT_M0,TT_M3 and A2.

A2:10-19    14.5
TTM0:800-900    850    
TTM3:1300-1650  1475

20160203:
Problem: It is not a good idea to bring TT_M0 in the estimation. Because it changes a lot compared with the last one. So, the next step will not have TT_M0 with TT_M3.

Solution:
we take the mean: RUE_pot=3.3269;TT_F1=708.7778,TT_M0=867.6284
and the parameters to be estimated will be TT_M3 and A2.

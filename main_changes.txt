Problem: 
the value of TT_F1 is designed to be less important than that of TT_M0, but from the distribution, it's not the case. And our PSO is not either such an intelligent one. 

Solution: 
my solution is simply to control their relation by limiting the range of searching space. It means that the upper bound of TT_F1 and the lower bound of TT_M0 are set to be 795.5

Problem: 
the distribution of TT_F1 is not so beautiful because some of them centralized at the upper bound. 

Solution:
the upper bound of TT_F1 is set to be smaller like 750

20160129:
Problem:
some of the TT_M0 estimation are centralized at the upper bound [950,1000].

Solution:
the upper bound of TT_M0 is changed to be 950.

Problem: Still, the TT_M0 distribution is not so beautiful, still some estimation at bound.

Solution:TT_M0:[800,900]
